# REACTGAMESITE - Upgraded
this application is an upgraded version of https://gamenerdmaster-o52gzqnew-adityagoyatt.vercel.app/ 
but here instead of vanilla react code like useEffect or useState, I have used popular libraries like React Query, Zustand and React Router.
the new features are Infinite Scrolling, additional page to render additional game data,etc. 
the css library being used is Chakra UI and the api to get data is rawg.io
